Maryland's population increased from 3,100,689 in 1960 to 5,785,982 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 86.6 percent.
<p>The foreign-born (FB) population decreased from 64,178 in 1960 to 803,695 in 2010.

<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p><u> The first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Net domestic migration (NDM) was consistantly negative, and B-D was the principal factor adding population, although NIM accounted for 46 percent of overall populatiion increase in the most recent period.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, NIM was the principal factor in population increase in the last two periods.
