<h3>Population</h3>
Florida's population increased from 4,951,560 in 1960 to 18,843,326 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 280.6 percent.
<p>The foreign-born (FB) population increased from 272,161 in 1960 to 3,658,043 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 1244.1 percent. The foreign-born share changed from 5.5 percent to 19.5 percent.</p>

<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p><u> The first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
All three factors contributed to population growth for all three periods, but NDM was the major factor until the most recent period.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, NIM became the dominant contributor to population increase in the two most recent periods, while B-D became negative as deaths among the native-born exceeded births.</p>
