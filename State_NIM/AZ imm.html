<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul></p>

<p>The <u>first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Until the most recent period, domestic migration (NDM) was the largest factor in population change.
In the most recent period, B-D became the largest factor.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, net immigration (NIM) became the largest factor in the most recent period.</p>
