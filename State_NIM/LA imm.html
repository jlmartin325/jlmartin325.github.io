That was an increase of 39.5 percent.
<p>The foreign-born (FB) population increased from 30,557 in 1960 to 172,866 in 2010.
That was an increase of 465.7 percent. The foreign-born share changed from 0.9 percent to 3.8 percent.</p>

<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p><u> The first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Natural change (B-D) was the primary factor in population increase in all three periods, offsetting a net loss fron NDM in the first two periods.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, NIM rose to more than one-third of the population increase in the 2010-13 period.</p>
