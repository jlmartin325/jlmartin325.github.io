<h1>North Dakota State Immigration</h1>
<h3>Population</h3>
North Dakota's population increased from 632,446 in 1960 to 674,449 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 6.6 percent.
<p>The foreign-born (FB) population decreased from 29,907 in 1960 to 16,639 in 2010.
That was a decrease of 44.4 percent. The foreign-born share changed from 4.7 percent to 2.5 percent.</p>

<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p>The <u>first chart</u> below shows the three population factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Natural change (B-D) was the factor adding the most population in the first two periods with NDM in that role in the most recent period.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, the relative positions of the factors were similar in adding and subtracting population, although NIM shifted to a population loss.</p>
