<h3>General</h3>

<p>Immigration adds to population growth as long as more immigrants are arriving than there are people leaving the country to live abroad (emigrating). 
The extent to which immigration is a major factor in U.S. population increase is little discussed, but data from the U.S. Census Bureau (CB) provides that information.</p>

<p>According to CB data, the United States population rose on average annually between 2000 and 2010 by about 2.8 million residents. 
That was down from the average annual increase between 1990 and 2000 of more than 3 million residents. </p>

<p>The resident foreign-born population (immigrants, long-term nonimmigrants and illegal aliens) rose by an annual average between 2000 and 2010 of about 900,000, and, during the 1990 to 2000 decade, the average annual increase was a bit more than 1.1 million residents.</p>

<p>These numbers suggest that the increase in the immigrant population accounted for about a third of the country’s overall population increase. 
But, actually, the impact of immigration on population increase is greater than that. 
The reason is that a larger share of the immigrant population is in its child-bearing years than the native-born population and a smaller share is in advanced age. 
So there is a disproportionate number of births to the immigrant population and fewer deaths. 
Other factors that add to the disproportional impact of immigrants on population increase include the average family size and earlier age of first birth. </p>

<p>The children born to resident aliens acquire U.S. citizenship, so their birth is not included in the CB data recording the increase in the immigrant population. 
But those births very much impact the rate of population increase. 
An estimate can be made to what extent that disproportionately large share of births and lower deaths compare to the overall population increase when added to the newly arriving foreign residents.</p>

<p>A key factor in assessing the overall share of population increase is the estimate that births to the foreign-born population in 2010 amounted to 25 percent of all births and at that time the foreign-born population was 12.5 percent of the U.S. population. 
Thus the foreign-born population’s share of births was double its size. 
Researchers at the Pew Hispanic Center provided similar but different numbers. 
They put the number of U.S. births by the foreign-born population at 23 percent and the share of foreign-born women in their child-bearing years (15-44) at 17 percent – again about twice their share. 

<p>On the national level, if this disproportionate share of births and lower death rate is taken into account as a share of the overall population increase resulting from immigration, the result is that it accounts for an estimated 68 percent of the increase for the period 2000 to 2009.  
Significantly, that share is increasing. For 1990 to 1999 the immigrant share of increase was about 59 percent. And for the most recent 2010 to 2013 period, the share is about 75 percent. 
The Pew Hispanic Center similarly projected that 82 percent of U.S. population growth from 2005 and 2050 “…will be due to immigrants arriving from 2005 to 2050 and their descendants.”  
If children born to immigrants already in the country before 2005 were added, that percentage would be still higher.</p>

<p><h3>Who Cares about Population Increase and Why?</h3></p>

<p>It is difficult to find an economist, businessman or politician who does not support population growth. 
They tend to see a growing population as more consumers and more constituents. Similarly, religious leaders see their faith advanced by an increase in the number of worshipers and educators see their careers benefit from growing numbers of students. This is one reason that these supporters of population growth tend to support increases in immigration. </p>

<p>But, even if it were accepted that population growth has an economic benefit, that would not mean that faster population growth would be more beneficial than slower population growth. 
The fast immigrant population growth of a century ago, i.e., “the great wave,” had serious drawbacks in job competition, stagnating wages, swelling ghettos-like ethnic urban enclaves. 
Public opposition to these aspects led to adoption of restrictive immigration in the early 1920s. 
A surge in foreign-born children challenges school classroom limits and services for non-English speaking students. 
The nation’s social welfare structure also is challenged by newcomers who use more in services than they contribute in taxes. </p>

<p>The challenge of immigration policy is to define a level of immigration that does not have an adverse impact on the overall society and on individual native-born citizens. 
The last national commission appointed to study that issue – the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform (USCIR) – recommended a reduction in the base level of immigration to 550,000 persons per year. That was a significant reduction from the then legal immigrant admission level of about 850,000. Today, legal immigrant admissions have further swelled to more than one million persons per year.</p>

<p>There are some who would like to see an even greater reduction in immigration than that recommended by the USCIR. 
The reason has nothing to do with where they come from or their race or religious belief. It results from a long-term perspective that indefinite growth is impossible and that in this country we are already seeing the effects of natural limits. Unfortunately, those who see population growth as a panacea wear blinders to the long-range consequences.</p>

<p>There currently is no realistic alternative to our economy’s dependence on finite and dwindling fossil fuels. 
Instead of battling over how to exploit those resources, we should be focused on how long they will continue to last. 
There is a fixed amount of freshwater resources for consumption, and both a growing population and agricultural production to feed it  place greater demands on that resource. Actually, in some areas the resource is already shrinking because of drought. 
Elsewhere, water in underground aquifers is being pumped out faster than it is replenished, which means they will run dry at some point. 
Those resources are vital to agricultural production, so if water resources diminish, sustained food production will be similarly challenged. 
Population growth also consumes land that could be used for agriculture or recreation or to protect the wildlife that are part of the environment we share and bear a responsibility to protect.</p>

<p>Reducing immigration would not be a solution for all of the problems of a growing population, but it can contribute to better management of increasingly overburdened resources. 
If immigration were reduced to the level of emigration (departing residents), that would significantly reduce the impact of immigration on population growth. 
That level of emigration is estimated to be about a third of a million persons per year. 
The adoption of an annual immigration level that low would still be higher than the level of immigration during the period of restricted entry between 1920 and 1970, but it would lead to a stable – non-growing – population within a few generations after the baby boom and ripple effects among the native-born population and the effects of the high immigrant birth rate recede. </p>

<h3>Caveat:</h3>

</u>The immigrant population varies significantly by area in terms of whether it is composed of legal or illegal residents, by nationality, and size. Therefore, the standardized calculations used to estimate the revised impact when births to immigrants are combined with net new arrivals are only approximations. </p>

<p>The CPS estimates do not reflect the Decennial Census results that often reveal that the earlier inter-Census population estimates underestimated the size of the foreign-born population. 
As a result there may be some variation between average annual change based on the Decennial Censuses and the change based on the CPS data.</p>
