<h3>Population</h3>
Alaska's population increased from 226,167 in 1960 to 713,985 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 215.7 percent.</p>
The foreign-born (FB) population increased from 8,227 in 1960 to 49,319 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 499.5 percent. The foreign-born share changed from 3.6 percent to 6.9 percent.</p>

<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p>The <u>first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Despite a constant population loss from NDM, the population increased from the other two factors: natural change (B-D) being the primary factor adding population.</p>


<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, B-D remained the primary factor adding population.</p>
