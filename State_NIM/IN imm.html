Indiana's population increased from 4,662,498 in 1960 to 6,490,621 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 39.2 percent.
<p>The foreign-born (FB) population increased from 93,203 in 1960 to 300,789 in 2010.
That was an increase of 222.7 percent. The foreign-born share changed from 2.0 percent to 4.6 percent.</p>

<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p><u> The first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Natural change (B-D) was the primary factor in population increase in all three periods while NDM changed from a positive factor to a negative one.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, B-D remained the chief factor in population increase, although NIM rose to about two-fifths of overall population increase in the most recent period.</p>
