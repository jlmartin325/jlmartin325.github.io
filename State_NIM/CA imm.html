<h3>Population</h3>
California's population increased from 15,717,204 in 1960 to 37,349,363 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 137.6 percent.
<p>The foreign-born (FB) population increased from 1,343,710 in 1960 to 10,150,429 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 655.4 percent. The foreign-born share changed from 8.5 percent to 27.2 percent.</p>

<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p>The <u>first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
All the population increase in each of the three periods is due to either natural change (B-D) or immigration (NIM) as there was a population loss - net outflow - from domestic migration (NDM). 
Natural change (B-D) was the primary factor in population increase for each of the three periods.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, NIM replaced B-D as the primary factor in population increase.</p>
