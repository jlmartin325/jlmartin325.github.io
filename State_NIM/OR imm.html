<h1>Oregon State Immigration</h1>
<h3>Population</h3>
Oregon's population increased from 1,768,687 in 1960 to 3,838,957 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 117.1 percent.
<p>The foreign-born (FB) population increased from 71,314 in 1960 to 375,743 in 2010.
That was an increase of 426.9 percent. The foreign-born share increased from 4.0 percent to 9.8 percent.</p>

<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p>The <u>first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Domestic migration (NDM) was the principal factor in population increase in the first two periods, and B-D took that position in the most recent period.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, NIM replaced B-D as the primary factor in adding population in the most recent period.</p>
