<h1>Rhode Island State Immigration</h1>
<h3>Population</h3>
Rhode Island's population increased from 859,488 in 1960 to 1,052,866 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 22.5 percent.
<p>The foreign-born (FB) population increased from 85,974 in 1960 to 134,335 in 2010.
That was an increase of 56.3 percent. The foreign-born share increased from 10.0 percent to 12.8 percent.</p>

<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p>The <u>first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Domestic migration (NDM) was consistently negative and the principal factor adding population changed from B-D in the first period to NIM in the latest two periods.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, NIM became the largest factor in adding population in all three periods, and became the sole factor adding population in the most recent period.</p>
