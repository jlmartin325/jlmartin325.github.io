<h1>Metropolitan Area Immigration</h1>
</head>

<body>
How has immigration changed the population of your metropolitan area over the past 40 years?
<p>	How much of the overall population change is the result of immigration?</p>
<p>	These questions are answered below using U.S. Census Bureau data and some calculations.</p>
<hr>
Census data for the overall population and the foreign-born (FB) or native-born (NB) population are readily available for the country, states and counties, and the data are shown in the graph for the nation below.

<p><pre>	<i>United States: Population  1960-2010</i>
	<img src="../State_NIM/US-pop.gif"></pre></p>

<p> This chart shows that the U.S. population increased from 179,323,175 in 1960 to 309,349,538 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 72.5 percent.
<p>The foreign-born (FB) population increased from 9,738,091 in 1960 to 39,955,854 in 2010.
That was an increase of 310.3 percent. The foreign-born share changed from 5.4 percent to 12.9 percent.</p>
<p>The share of the overall population that was native-born (NB) increased by 58.5 percent.</p>

<p>What is more difficult to find is the share of population change that results from immigration.
<p>The Census Bureau periodically issues data collected from the annual Current Population Survey (CPS) that identifies population change from:
<uL>
<li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a usually small residueal "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p>The NIM category, however, understates the impact of immigration on population change because immigration tends to add a dsproporionate amout births to the B-D category.
This is because a much larger share of immigrants is in the child-bearing age, immigrants on average have larger families, and fewer immigrants are in the older population reaching the end of life.
<p>We, therefore, offer a perspective that reflects how much more immigration may be influencing population change. 
This is done by adjusting the B-D data to reflect just births and deaths among the native-born population and not the foreign-born population's higher birth numbers and lower death numbers. 
This calculation is, of course, only illustritive and not a precise measurement.
We can demonstrate this effect with two charts for the nation.</p>

<p>The <u>first chart</u> for the country shows the population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Because domestic migration among the states balances out at zero for the nation, NDM does not appear in these charts..  
The B-D accounted for about two-thirds of the average annual change in population in each period, and net immigration accounted (NIM) for the other about one-third of the change.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect moving the B-D effects of the immigrant population from B-D to NIM.
In it, the population effect of net immigration (NIM) has consistently been the major factor in population change, and, as immigration has increased over time, it most recently has accounted for nearly three-fourths of the total change.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>The charts and data for Metropolitan areas is based on 2013 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definitions. They comprise one or more counties in which the population is generally oriented for employment and commerce toward a principal city.
Because the OMB metro area boundaries have changed over time, the data used have been standardized for comparability on the current boundary definitions. 
Also for comparability, the CPS births, deaths and net migration data have been adjusted to an annual rate of change.</p>
