<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p>The <u>first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Immigration (NIM) was the major factor in population increase in the first period, and that role was held by B-D for the two most recent periods.
</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, NIM was the primary factor adding population in all periods. This demonstrates that even though net immigration is near zero - as in the most recent period, a large foreign-born population may still account for most of population increase through the surplus of births over deaths.</p>
