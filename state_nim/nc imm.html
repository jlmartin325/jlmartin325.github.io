<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p>The <u>first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Domestic migration (NDM) was the largest component of population increase for the first two periods, and B-D for the most recent period.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, NIM accounted for the largest share of population increase in the most recent period.</p>
