<h1>Population and Immigration</h1>
Immigration adds to population growth as long as more immigrants are arriving than there are people leaving the country to live abroad (emigrating). The extent to which immigration is a major factor in U.S. population increase is little discussed, but data from the U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) provides that information.

According to USCB data, the United States population rose on average annually between 2000 and 2010 by about 2.8 million residents. That was down from the average annual increase between 1990 and 2000 of more than 3 million residents. 

The resident foreign-born population (immigrants, long-term nonimmigrants and illegal aliens) rose by an annual average between 2000 and 2010 of about 900,000, and, during the 1990 to 2000 decade, the average increase was a bit more than 1.1 million residents.

These numbers suggest that the increase in the immigrant population accounts for about a third of the country’s overall population increase. But, actually, the impact of immigration on population increase is greater than that. The reason is that a larger share of the immigrant population is in its child-bearing years than the native-born population and a smaller share is in advanced age. So there is a disproportionate number of births to the immigrant population and fewer deaths. Other factors that add to the disproportional impact of immigrants on population increase include the average family size and earlier age of first birth. 

The children born to resident aliens acquire U.S. citizenship, so their birth is not included in the increase in the immigrant population. But those births very much impact the rate of population increase. An estimate can be made to what extent that disproportionately large share of births and lower deaths compare to the overall population increase when added to the newly arriving foreign residents.

A key factor in assessing the overall share of population increase is the estimate that births to the foreign-born population in 2010 amounted to 25 percent of all births and at that time the foreign-born population was 12.5 percent of the U.S. population. Thus the foreign-born population’s share of births was double its size. Similarly, the Pew Hispanic Center noted that, “The 2010 birth rate for foreign-born women … was nearly 50% higher than the rate for U.S.-born women.”
