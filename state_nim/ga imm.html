<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<UL><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p><u> The first chart</u> below shows NDM as the largest factor in population change in the first period, replaced by B-D in the two most recent periods.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, NDM became the main factor adding population in the second period and NIM became the primary factor in the most recent period.</p>
