<h1>Observations</h1>

<p>Immigration adds to
population growth as long as more immigrants are arriving than there are U.S. residents
leaving the country to live abroad (emigrating). The extent to which
immigration is a major factor in U.S. population increase is little discussed,
but data from the U.S. Census Bureau (CB) provides that information.</p>

<p>According to CB data, the
United States population rose on average annually between 2000 and 2010 by
about 2.8 million residents. That was down from the average annual increase
between 1990 and 2000 of more than 3 million residents. </p>

<p>The foreign-born
population (immigrants, long-term nonimmigrants and illegal aliens) rose by an
annual average between 2000 and 2010 of about 900,000 residents, and, during the 1990 to
2000 decade, the average annual increase was a bit more than 1.1 million
residents.</p>

<p>These numbers suggest that
the increase in the immigrant population accounted for about a third of the
country's overall population increase. But, actually, the impact of immigration
on population increase is greater than that. The reason is that a larger share
of the immigrant population is in its child-bearing years than the native-born
population and a smaller share is in advanced age. So there is
a disproportionate number of births to the immigrant population and fewer
deaths. Other factors that add to the disproportional impact of immigrants on
population increase include the average family size and earlier age of first
birth.</p>

<p>The children born to resident
aliens acquire U.S. citizenship, so their birth is not included in the CB data
that record the change from Net International Migration (NIM). But those births very much
impact the rate of population increase. An estimate can be made of the overall impact of immigration on population increase by adding an estimate of births and deaths to immigrants to the NIM data.</p>

<p>A key assumption in estimating the
overall share of population increase attributable to the
foreign-born population is derived from the fact that in 2010, when the foreign-born population was 12.5 percent of the U.S. population, it accounted for 25 percent of the nation's births.
Thus the foreign-born population's share of births was double its size.
</p>

<p>On the national level, if
this disproportionate share of births and a lower death rate are combined with
the population increase from net
immigration, the result is an estimated 68 percent share of the
increase for the period 2000 to 2009. Significantly, that share is increasing.
For 1990 to 1999 the immigrant share of increase was about 59 percent. And <b>for
the most recent 2010 to 2013 period, the immigrant share of population increase was about 75 percent</b>. The Pew
Hispanic Center similarly projected that 82 percent of U.S. population growth
from 2005 to 2050, "...will be due to immigrants arriving from 2005 to 2050 and
their descendants." If children born to immigrants already in the country
before 2005 were added, that percentage would be still higher.</p>

<h3>Who Cares about Population Increase and Why?</h3>

<p>It is difficult to find an
economist, businessman or politician who does not assume population growth is a necessary component of economic growth.
They tend to see a growing population as more consumers and more constituents.
Similarly, religious leaders see their faith advanced by an increase in the
number of worshippers and educators see their careers benefit from growing
numbers of students. This view of population growth as a benefit thus represents a vested interest. </p>

<p>But, even if it were accepted
that some population growth has an economic benefit, that
would not mean that faster population growth would be more beneficial than
slower population growth. The fast immigrant population growth of a century
ago, i.e., "the great wave," had serious drawbacks in job competition,
stagnating wages, and swelling ghettos-like ethnic urban enclaves. Public
opposition to these aspects led to adoption of restrictive immigration in the
early 1920s. A surge in foreign-born children challenges,among other things, school classroom
space limits and services for non-English speaking students. The nation's social
welfare structure also is challenged by newcomers who consume more in services than
they contribute in taxes. </p>

<p>The challenge of immigration
policy should be to define a level of immigration that does not have an adverse impact
on the overall society and on individual native-born citizens. The last
national commission appointed to study that issue - the U.S. Commission on
Immigration Reform (USCIR) - recommended a reduction in the base level of
immigration to 550,000 persons per year. That was a significant reduction from
the then annual average legal immigrant admission level of about 850,000 persons. Today, legal
immigrant admissions have further swelled to an average of more than one million persons per
year.</p>

<p>There are some who would like
to see an even greater reduction in immigration than that recommended by the
USCIR. The reason has nothing to do with where immigrants come from or their race or
religious belief. It results from a long-term perspective that indefinite
growth is impossible and that in this country we are already seeing the effects
of exceeding natural limits. Unfortunately, those who see population growth as a panacea
wear blinders to the long-range consequences.</p>

<p>There currently is no
realistic alternative to our economy's dependence on finite and dwindling
fossil fuels. Instead of battling over how best to exploit those resources, we
should be focused on how long they will last. There is a fixed
amount of freshwater resources, and both a growing population
and agricultural production to feed that population place greater demands on that resource.
In some areas the resource is already shrinking because of drought.
Elsewhere, water in underground aquifers is being pumped out faster than it is
replenished, which means they will run dry at some point. Those resources are
vital to agricultural production, so if water resources diminish, food production will be similarly challenged. Population growth also consumes
land that could be used for agriculture or recreation or to protect the
wildlife that are part of the environment that we share and bear a responsibility to
protect.</p>

<p>Reducing immigration would
not be a solution for all of the problems of a growing population, but it can
contribute to better management of increasingly overburdened resources. If
immigration were reduced to the level of emigration (departing residents), that
would significantly reduce the role of immigration in population growth. That
level of emigration is estimated to be about a third of a million persons per
year. The adoption of annual immigration to that level would still be
higher than the level of immigration during the period of restricted entry
between 1920 and 1970, but it would contribute to a stable - non-growing - population. 
Within a few generations - after the baby boom and ripple effects among the
native-born population and the effects of the high immigrant birth rate recede - the population could become stable.
</p>

<h3>Caveat:</h3>

<p>The immigrant population varies significantly by region in
terms of composition (whether legal or illegal residents or long-term nonimmigrants), by nationality,
and size. Therefore, the standardized calculations used to estimate the revised
impact of immigration on population change  are
approximations. </p>

<p>The Current Population Survey (CPS) estimates do not
reflect the Decennial Census results that are used to revise the earlier
inter-Census population estimates. The adjustments have resulted from underestimating the size of the foreign-born
population. As a result there are differences in some areas between average annual population 
change based on the Decennial Census and the annual change based on the CPS data.</p>
