That was an increase of 20.0 percent.
<p>The foreign-born (FB) population increased from 18,577 in 1960 to 22,238 in 2010.
That was an increase of 19.7 percent. The foreign-born share was 2.7 percent in 1960 and 2.7 percent in 2010.</p>

<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p>The <u>first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
The largest factor adding population in all periods was B-D.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, there was little change in the relative importance of the three factors because of the small foreign-born share in the state.
