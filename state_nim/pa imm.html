<h1>Pennsylvania State Immigration</h1>
<h3>Population</h3>
Pennsylvania's population increased from 11,319,366 in 1960 to 12,709,630 in 2010. 
That was an increase of 12.3 percent.
<p>The foreign-born (FB) population increased from 603,490 in 1960 to 739,068 in 2010.
That was an increase of 22.5 percent. The foreign-born share increased from 5.3 percent to 5.8 percent.</p>

<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p>The <u>first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Domestic migration (NDM) was consistently negative and the principal factor adding population changed from B-D in the first period to NIM in the latest two periods.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, NIM rose from being a bare majority of population increase in the unadjusted data to a large majority in the adjusted data; becoming nearly the sole factor adding population in the most recent period.</p>
