That was an increase of 135.5 percent.
<p>The foreign-born (FB) population increased from 15,542 in 1960 to 87,098 in 2010.

<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p><u> The first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Domestic migration (NDM) was the largest factor adding population in the first period, and B-D in the latest two periods.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, domestic migration (NDM) replaced natural change (B-D) in the second period as the largest factor in population increase.</p>
