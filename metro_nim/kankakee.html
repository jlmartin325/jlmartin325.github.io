<h3>Sources of Population Change</h3>

The primary sources of population change are:
<ul><li>Natural Change [Births minus Deaths or B-D];</li>
<li>Net Domestic Migration [NDM - movement between states]; and</li>
<li>Net International Migration [NIM - movement into and out of the country].</li>
<li>There is also a residual "other" amount that isn't placed in one of those three categories.
</ul>

<p>The <u>first chart</u> below shows the three population change factors for three periods adjusted for annual average amounts. 
Natural change (B-D) was the main source of added population in all periods.</p>

<p>The <u>second chart</u> shows the same data but with an adjustment to reflect births to immigrants shifted to NIM.
In it, B-D remained the primary source of population increase in all periods although nearly equalled in the most recent period.</p>
